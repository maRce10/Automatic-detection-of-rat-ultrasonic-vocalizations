This repository contains the example data and code to automatically detect rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USV). The examples sound files are found at `./data/raw/sound_files`. Automatic detection is conducted with the R package [ohun](https://docs.ropensci.org/ohun/). Detection are further curated by mitigating false positives with a Random Forest on spectrographic features. 

## Analysis

This script details the entire process of analysis, from sound file formatting to summarizing results:

The script offers code to detect USVs in three possible escenarios:

- Detect 55 kHz USVs in the presence of bedding
- Detect 55 kHz USVs with no bedding
- Detect 22 kHz USVs with no bedding

Associated random forest models are hosted at:
